                <i>sudden and heavy rainfall in Thessaloniki and other parts of northern Greece caused major traffic disruption and other problems on Monday.

                  Due to the hours of rainfall, many regional roads were flooded, blocking motorists and leading to several road accidents though no injuries had been reported by late afternoon.

                  In Halkidiki, where similar weather conditions prevailed, the regional fire service was called dozens of times to pump out flooded ground-floor and basement apartments and businesses.</i></b></p>

                    Central Canada and northern Canada experiences subarctic and Arctic climates, much of them arid. Those areas are not heavily populated due to the severe climate, where it drops below −20 °C (−4 °F) on most winter days and has a very brief summer season.

                      Today
                      A largely fine day is expected, with some sunny spells, especially at first. However some cloud is expected to bubble up through the day, and whilst this could bring one or two light showers, most places should stay day.

                      Tonight
                      Any very isolated showers will soon fade away, leading to a dry overnight period. Winds will also gradually ease, with some clearer spells developing.

                            Weather in New Zealand can change unexpectedly. Be prepared and understand what you can expect from different seasons below.

                            While the far north has subtropical weather during summer, and inland alpine areas of the South Island can be as cold as -10°C (14°F) in winter, most of the country lies close to the coast, which means mild temperatures.

                            The average New Zealand temperature decreases as you travel south. January and February are the warmest months, and July is the coldest month of the year.

                            You can check on New Zealand weather conditions on the Met Service website.
